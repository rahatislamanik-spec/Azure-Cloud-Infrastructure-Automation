## Overview

This project covers the full Azure infrastructure lifecycle — from initial resource deployment through security hardening, governance, monitoring, and cost control. Every configuration was applied hands-on using the Azure Portal, Azure Cloud Shell, and Infrastructure as Code, reflecting the operational decisions an Azure administrator makes in a real cloud environment.

The work spans four core domains: infrastructure automation, operations and governance, security and secrets management, and cost visibility. Each area builds on the last — a deployment without governance is ungoverned, governance without monitoring is invisible, and monitoring without cost control is expensive.

## What Was Built

### Infrastructure & Automation

**Azure Resource Deployment — Portal and Cloud Shell**
Resources were deployed using both the Azure Portal for visual configuration and Azure Cloud Shell (Bash) for scripted, repeatable operations — mirroring the dual-mode approach used in enterprise Azure environments where some resources are provisioned interactively and others through pipelines.

**Infrastructure as Code — ARM Templates**
ARM templates were implemented to define and deploy Azure infrastructure declaratively. IaC removes the dependency on manual portal clicks, ensures consistent environments, and creates an auditable deployment record — foundational to any production Azure operation.

**Virtual Networking — Network Security Groups**
Secure virtual networking was configured using Network Security Groups (NSGs). Inbound and outbound traffic rules were defined to control resource exposure, restrict access by port and protocol, and enforce network-level segmentation between workloads.

**Serverless — Azure Functions**
Azure Functions were deployed and tested to support event-driven, serverless workloads — demonstrating the ability to extend cloud infrastructure beyond VMs and containers into lightweight compute that scales automatically.

### Operations & Governance

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
RBAC was implemented across Azure subscriptions to control who can do what to which resources. Role assignments were scoped at the appropriate level — subscription, resource group, or resource — following least-privilege principles to prevent over-permissioned access.

**Azure Monitor — Resource Health & Metrics**
Azure Monitor was configured to track resource health, availability, and operational metrics across the deployed environment. Monitoring is the operational layer that makes everything else visible — without it, failures and anomalies go undetected.

**Cost Management — Spending Visibility & Governance**
Azure Cost Management was used to track and optimize cloud spending across the environment. Cost governance prevents uncontrolled resource sprawl and is a core responsibility for any cloud operations role.

### Security & Secrets Management

**Azure Key Vault — Secrets & Encryption**
Azure Key Vault was implemented to centralize secrets management and encryption key handling. Credentials and configuration data were stored in Key Vault rather than hardcoded in scripts or templates — a non-negotiable security practice in any production Azure environment.

**Least-Privilege Access**
Least-privilege access principles were applied throughout — RBAC scoped tightly, Key Vault access policies restricted to required identities, and sensitive resources protected from over-exposure. Every permission granted was intentional.
